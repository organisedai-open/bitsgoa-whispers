  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"test","channel":"test"}'
```

  echo "Request $i"
done
```

### Input Sanitization Test
```bash

curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"<script>alert(1)</script>","channel":"general"}'

# Test HTML stripping
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"<b>bold</b> text","channel":"general"}'
```
